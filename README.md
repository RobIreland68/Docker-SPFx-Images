# Docker-SPFx-Images
Docker Build files for SPFx Development

Docker file to create an Linux image for SPfx development using @microsoft/sharepoint generator and the Microsoft CLI. I use this Docker build file to support training of SPFx developers please note that although this is a public repository it may not support the latest features as I only update the repository occassionally.

# Note: #
For more information about using SPFx and Docker, please see Waldek's comprehensive work and repository

Use Docker Build . to create the image and upload it to Docker Desktop
i.e Docker build -t rireland/spfx-mcli:1.15.0
