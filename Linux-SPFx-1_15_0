# Docker file to create an Linux image for SPfx development using @microsoft/sharepoint generator
# and the Microsoft CLI. I use this Docker build file to support training of SPFx developers
# please note that although this is a public repository it may not support the latest features
# as I only update the repository occassionally.
#
# Note: For more information about using SPFx and Docker, please see Waldek's comprehensive
# work and repository
# https://github.com/waldekmastykarz

# Use Docker Build . to create the image and upload it to Docker Desktop
# i.e Docker build -t rireland/spfx-mcli:1.15.0

# This version uses SPfx 1.15.0 which does not include a local workbench
# all testing must be done using the hosted workbench with a SharePoint Online site
# see the 1.15.0 release notes for more information
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/release-1.15

# Expose network ports for local testing
EXPOSE 5432 4321 35729

# Set up environment variables and path
ENV NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=/usr/app/.npm-global \
  PATH=$PATH:/usr/app/.npm-global/bin

# Create a working directory called /usr/app/spfx
